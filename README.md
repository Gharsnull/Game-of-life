# Game of life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can be either "alive" or "dead". The cells follow a set of rules that determine their state in the next generation. The game has no players, it is simply a simulation of the behavior of the cells over time.

This project is a web-based implementation of the Game of Life using Angular 15.0.2. Users can interact with the cells by toggling them on or off, and then watch as the cells evolve over time according to the game's rules.

## How to play
1. To set up the initial state of the cells, click on the cells you want to toggle. Black cells represent live cells, while white cells represent dead cells.

2. To quickly select cells, press and hold the "Shift" key while moving your mouse over the cells you want to bring to life.

3. Clicking on a live cell will kill it and return it to its initial state.

4. Press the "Space" key to go to the next generation of cells. You can also keep the key pressed to see how your pattern evolves over time.
